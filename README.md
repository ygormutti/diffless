# diffless

An extensible, programming language aware, high signal-to-noise ratio diff tool.

## Why?

Have you ever...

* refactored and styled code, tried to review the changes and had hard times understanding what *really* changed?
* gave up understanding diff output and decided to just read the entire code
* redid your changes atop another version to feel safe while merging branches, or even worse...
* avoided branching and concurrent work on the same code fearing merge conflicts
* tried "smart" diff tools that...
  * charged you for an expensive subscription or license
  * didn't support the language you were using;
  * were closed source, so you couldn't implement support for it either;
  * were halfway done or hard to use? (like most academic tools)

If so, diffless was made specially for you.

## What?

The idea behind diffless is that the more you use it, the less you use it. :)

Ok, let me rephrase that... if diffless becomes your diff tool of choice you will spend less time reading diff outputs, because you will understand changes faster.

Even if it doesn't support the programming language of what you're comparing you can get an improved diff output out of it, and you can easily extend it too, adding support for your favorite languages, creating your own view for it, integrating it with your code editor, unit testing library, etc.

## How?

I'm still figuring it out, haha.
